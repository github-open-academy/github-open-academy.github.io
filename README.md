# Concept
  - Udemy/Linda/Pluralsight FREE alternative
  - Curated youtube videos to create a course/module whatever you wanna call it
  - Serverless (Utilizing github pages, github api and youtube)
  - Can be run locally without node, npm, server etc by just viewing the file on a browser
  - Open and free to anyone who has github account both curator (fork and edit) and learners (maximize rate limit)

Let me know if there are already existing websites with the same concepts above so I can take this down.

Thank you!

# TODO
  - Favicon
  - Search
  - Caching
  - UI for using access_token to maximize rate_limit (without caching)
